I'm hoping that by building this project I'll be able to learn more about machine learning and build my own ai models

Side note: this project will contain a lot of files in pieces because I'm still in the process of learning how to use pytorch


As of right now, I'm learning the pytorch module for deep learning first, then resuming this project
