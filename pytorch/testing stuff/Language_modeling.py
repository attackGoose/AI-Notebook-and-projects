##im thinking of testing both the BERT and GPT architecture, starting wtih BERT since i wrote it first, then test their performance on NLP and text generation for chatting with

## im also thinking that by making a chatbot, i can just have it build off of what we tell it, like "hey how are you" it can build off of that in a conversation like way like
# "I'm doing fine, just going to go for a walk somewhere"
# so I'm guessing that the training data that we give it is going to be a very conversation like thingy
# this method is primarily like a sentence/phrase completion which I feel like is still good as a chat bot and will need to be trained on text data that's very conversation like
